# Identification for the network the scheduler and daemon run on. 
# You can have several distinct icecream networks in the same LAN
# for whatever reason.
#
ICECREAM_NETNAME="configfilenetname"

# If the daemon can't find the scheduler by broadcast (e.g. because 
# of a firewall) you can specify it.
#
ICECREAM_SCHEDULER_HOST="10.0.101.32"

# You can overwrite here the number of jobs to run in parallel. Per
# default this depends on the number of (virtual) CPUs installed. 
#
# Note: a value of "0" is actually interpreted as "1", however it
# also sets ICECREAM_ALLOW_REMOTE="no".
#
ICECREAM_MAX_JOBS=""

# Specifies whether jobs submitted by other nodes are allowed to run on
# this one.

ICECREAM_ALLOW_REMOTE="no"
